## 🧪 Sample Test Queries Evaluated

- "I’m sweating, shaky, and my glucometer reads 55 mg/dL—what should I do right now?"
- "My diabetic father just became unconscious; we think his sugar crashed."
- "Crushing chest pain shooting down my left arm—do I chew aspirin first or call an ambulance?"
- "CKD patient with a potassium level of 6.1 mmol/L—what emergency measures can we start right away?"

---

## ⚠ Known Limitations

- 🧠 **LLM Hallucination**: Still possible, especially with ambiguous or missing data.
- 🔧 **Inconsistent JSON formatting** unless strict prompt enforcement is applied.
- 🌐 **Serper.dev search** may include outdated or low-quality links on occasion.
- 🚫 **No offline fallback** if web search fails or API quota is exceeded.
- 💬 **No multilingual support** tested — current prompts are tuned for English.

---

## 💡 Opportunities for Improvement

- ✅ Use `function calling` or `tool use` if supported by OpenAI Assistants API
- ✅ Add retry logic + schema validation for structured outputs
- ✅ Apply query caching to reduce web latency
- ✅ Add a confidence score or reranker to improve citation ordering
- ✅ Support multilingual inputs (via translation or few-shot prompting)

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

The chatbot is robust, fast, and reliable for most diabetes/cardiac/renal triage cases. With some minor improvements in prompt design and response parsing, it can be deployed safely for educational and public awareness use cases.
